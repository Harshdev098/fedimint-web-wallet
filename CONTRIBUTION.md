## Technical Note

This wallet is built using the **[Fedimint Web SDK](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint-web-sdk)**, which:

- Loads *WebAssembly (WASM)* modules compiled from Fedimintâ€™s Rust code.
- Uses *Web Workers* to execute WASM tasks in the background without blocking the UI.
- Provides RPC calls to interact with the federation, handle e-cash, Lightning payments, and on-chain transactions directly in the browser.

If you want to understand or extend the wallet's core logic, you can explore:
- *Fedimint Web SDK*: Learn how the WASM module is initialized and how the SDK functions are used in the wallet.
- *Fedimint Rust repository*: Understand the backend implementation that powers the federation logic and RPC endpoints.

ðŸ“š Helpful links:
- [Fedimint Main Repository](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint)
- [Fedimint Web SDK Repository](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint-web-sdk)

Understanding these will help to contribute more effectively, especially when working on features that interact with the federation directly.
